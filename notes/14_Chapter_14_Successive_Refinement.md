# Chapter 14: Successive Refinement

This chapter is a case study in successive refinement. You will see a module that started 
well but did not scale. Then you will see how the module was refactored and cleaned.

## Notes
- To write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it.
- One of the best ways to ruin a program is to make massive changes to its structure in the name of improvement
- using TDD, I am not allowed to make a change to the system that breaks that system
- It is not enough for code to work. Code that works is often badly broken. 
  Programmers who satisfy themselves with merely working code are behaving unprofessionally.
