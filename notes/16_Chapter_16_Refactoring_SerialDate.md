# Chapter 16: Refactoring SerialDate

We have a **SerialDate** class from `org.jfree.date` and we want to refactor it.

## First make it work
we added some unit tests to cover %92 of code which was covered only %50 before.

found some bugs and fixed along the way

## Then make it right
We refactored and splitted code into more pieces to make it more readable.
